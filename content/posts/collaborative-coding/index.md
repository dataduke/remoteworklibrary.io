Writing code in teams is always collaborative. But how to perform effective collaboration practices like pair programming or code walkthroughs in remote settings?
<!--more-->

## What is Collaborative Coding?

Collaborative coding is about interpreting coding as a collaborative effort and providing tools and practices which improve the depth and productivity of code-level collaboration - especially in fully or partially remote settings.

## Why use it?

Important code-level collaborative practices like pair programming, code walkthroughs, and walking around and ask others for feedback do not work out-of-the-box in remote settings.

## How to do it?

There are at least three different kinds of collaborative code practices which can be enabled by different kinds of tools:

* **Social coding**: Code sharing and accessibility (with tools like [GitHub](https://github.com), [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/)), and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
* **Driver / navigator pattern**: The driver writes code, and the navigator tells the driver what to do. Driver and navigator swap their roles from time to time. You need nothing more than a [video conferencing]({{< ref "/posts/video-conferencing/index.md" >}}) solution for a driver / navigator collaboration.
* **Code discussions**: Comment, peer review, and discuss code with [inline comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comment_(computer_programming)), Google Docs like commenting & suggestion features (e.g. provided by [codestream](https://www.codestream.com/), [TeamHub](https://teamhub.dev/)), peer review tools (like [Upsource](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/upsource/)), or [pull/merge requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) in social coding tools.
* **Co-creation**: Writing code together simultaneously by working in a shared editor. Changes of everybody are visible in realtime. There are desktop-level co-creation tools like [USE together](https://www.use-together.com/) which are not stitched to any dev tool or realtime collaboration editors like [floobits](https://Floobits.com/), [VS.code Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/), or [Atom Teletype](https://teletype.atom.io)
