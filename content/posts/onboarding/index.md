The first days in a new company are important: Getting productive quickly, meeting colleagues and breathing in the company culture. But how does that work remotely?

<!--more-->

## What is it?

Remote Onboarding is the process of integrating new employees who are not onsite into an organization.

## Why use it?

New employees should gain the knowledge and skills they need to quickly become productive members of an organisation, even if they are not onsite. Besides, the social component is also important for a successful integration of new employees.

## How to do it?

* First, contact the new employee and inform him/her that the start will be online
* Send a welcome package to his/her home containing the hardware, a description of the first steps and all access keys. Also send the contact details of people who can assist if there are questions (e.g. number of technical support, mentor). Clarify the expectations, so that the new colleague does not feel the pressure to have everything to set up independently before the first day.
* Before the first day, the mentor should prepare the tasks and a schedule for the first week and invite the new employee to upcoming meetings
* Organize a welcome video call for the first day with all new employees. It allows them to meet other new employees and have their first “allies”
* After the short welcome meeting, the new employees meet their project team and will get all the information they need to start working
* For a smooth social integration you can organize non-work meetings like virtual lunches or coffee breaks. Additionally, the mentor should encourage the new employee to join communities. We use for example the slack app donut. Every Tuesday this app connects three employees for a virtual coffee break.
* Schedule appointments with other departments like HR or the IT-department, as they can give further information about internal processes
* Make sure the new employee has a meeting with his/her manager
* Introduce the new employee to the organisation in the virtual company meeting
* Organize a feedback meeting after a few weeks to see whether the employee is happy in his new position
