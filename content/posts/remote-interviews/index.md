Onsite interviews are ideal for both parties to get to know each other from a professional and cultural perspective. This post describes how it also works in a remote setting.

## What is it?

It is a process for hiring remotely.

## Why use it?

Remote interviews enable hiring new employees without having onsite interviews.

## How to do it?

### Before the interview:

* Decide for a video call tool which is easy to use for all participants and respects the GDPR
* Reflect if you need additional tools. For example, if the interviewee has to solve a technical task during the interview
* Inform the candidates about your remote recruiting process and explain them why you are recruiting remotely
* Invite the candidate to a video call and ask if a remote interview is fine. If the candidate prefers an onsite meeting, try to organize a meeting onsite or explain him/her why you are not able to meet onsite.
* Send the login credentials and inform the candidate about the procedure. Don't forget to send your contact details (including a telephone number) in case the candidate needs to get in touch with you, i.e. if there is a technical issue
* Share your remote meeting guidelines (see [Meeting Guideline]({{< ref "/posts/meeting-guideline/index.md" >}})) and inform the
candidate about the dress code
* Make sure you have enough time for the meeting
* If you are more than one interviewer, prepare a clear structure of the meeting and decide who will be the moderator

### During the interview:

* Start the interview with a warm welcome and make sure all participants can hear you
* If needed, give a short introduction to the use of the video call tool
* Explain the agenda und keep track of the time. If the interview lasts longer, don't forget to make breaks.
* Speak into the camera and smile. As the candidate can only see your face, a smile is an important sign for the candidate and helps him/her to be less nervous.
* The ongoing interview is equivalent to interviews onsite. Use a combination of technical and cultural questions. During a virtual interview it seems to be more difficult to get a feel for the person. Therefore, we focus more on questions regarding the cultural fit.
* Be aware that the time between question and answer seems to be longer than in face-to-face interviews. Thus, allow the candidate to take his/her time before answering to not stress him/her.
* You can use telepresence hardware to take a virtual walk through the office with the candidate (see [Telepresence]({{< ref "/posts/telepresence/index.md" >}}))
